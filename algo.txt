Introduction to algorithms (you already know what is an algorithms).
Time complexity analysis
Searching algorithms:
- Linear search.
- Binary search.
- Lower bound .
- Upper bound.
- Sequential search.
Sorting Algorithms:
- SBI (selection, bubble, insertion).
- Merge sort.
- Heap sort.
- Quick sort "use it everywhere, it worked well for all algorithms".
String search algorithms:
- Basics. string, string reverse, palindromesub-string, prefix, suffix, borderanagramSearching for pattern.Naive "compare each char of pattern (P) to each char of text (T)".
- KMP
- Boyer Moore
- Suffix array "simply, indexes of sorted suffixes of a string - oh this is very important, saves a lot of run time, so your tests pass easily".
- LCP array "1st entry is undefined, other entries are longest common prefix lengths of (1st and 0th index of Suffix array of a string, & so on)".
Graph Theory:
- BFS
- DFS
- pre-order "node, left, then right".
- post-order "left, right, then node".
- in-order "left, node, then right".
- Binary tree "max 2 nodes".
- Binary search tree.
- Trees.
